# HTML Form Elements

###### April 2020

_I made this page as I was learning about HTML form elements and I wanted to try some of them out. I enjoy putting into practice what I am learning and find that it is a good way of helping me to remember things. It has proved a useful learning tool as I have come back to this page a few times to refresh myself on the subject. I also really enjoyed styling this page and making it look like a notebook!_
